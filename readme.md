# Why stopped developing the API with AWS S3?
AWS is not free at all. It takes money if I don't pay AWS then my service will be stopped. <br>

I have a great time playing with Amazon Web Services. But I think I have to change the entire file system 
just for this AWS stopped their service demanding me to pay!
